# Interactive visual manipulation of large-scale line data

## Short Abstract

> As datasets grow in size, the demand for efficient rendering and manipulation of this data intensifies. 
> This research paper explores how GPU shaders can significantly enhance the processing of large-scale line data. 
> In addition, various (semi-automatic) interaction tools are explored to optimally cluster line data and effectively 
> select certain lines to be in or out of focus.

## Title and Research Question

> "Interactive visual manipulation of large-scale line data"

The term “large scale” refers to thousands or millions of (PCP) lines; this can be, for example,
millions of RIS data lines <Cite papers={papers} paperId="mst/2022_gch_andra" /> or large-scale
weather data <Cite papers={papers} paperId="mst/Albero" /> <Cite papers={papers} paperId="mst/ZHAO2015156" />.
I would like to focus on fuzzy-clustering <Cite papers={papers} paperId="mst/shimony2002automated" /> certain
line groups by guiding a user by pulling certain lines in or out of context. My research questions
are stated as follows:

- (Main question) How to, as an expert using the system, effectively cluster large-scale line data with minimal effort?
  - How to optimally (with as few clicks) select certain lines to be in or out of focus?
  - How to help a user to cluster lines in a semi-automatic way?
  - How to make the rendering of large-scale line data more efficient?

## Background

To gain a better understanding of how this research differs from previous work, it is important
to understand the current state of the art. This section explains what others have done in the fields
of selecting large-scale high-dimensional, rendering, and clustering line data.

Many authors have attemted to solve the problem of clustering (large-scale) point data

  ]}
/>

. This is done by using a variety of techniques, such as the use of a
Mahalanobis brush <Cite papers={papers} paperId="mst/fan2021sketch" /> or a
fuzzy classifier

<CiteList
  papers={papers}
  paperIds={["mst/9120181", "mst/YANG19931", "mst/shimony2002automated"]}
/>
. or K-means++ clustering with a lightweight neural network
<Cite papers={papers} paperId="mst/10410948" />. This paper will borow some of
these techniques and apply them to 2D line data.

Fewer research has been done on clustering large-scale line data. 
One of the few papers that has been written about this is the work by 
Trautner <Cite papers={papers} paperId="mst/trautner2021line" />. This paper
assumed the data to be pre-clustered and only focused on the rendering of the data. However, the 
rendering technique does prioritise well-segmented clusters and renders them in a way that 
makes them stand out. This paper will focus on the clustering of the data and will use the 
rendering technique as a way to show the user the clusters.

When a lines are not yet clustered, the data can be hard to differentiate when many lines are drawn.
A line plot with many groups (>6) is commonly called a “spaghetti plot” [^1]. These plots are often 
used in meteorology to visualize weather patterns [^2]. A common 
downside is that many lines visualized in one plot can be hard to read for an expert. A trivial way 
to reduce this clutter, is to display lines with certain channels from T. Munzner [^11] 
like color, size, and transparency. A. Kamal et al. [^6] assumes that the lines originate from a certain mean-line that has multiple   
uses branches of noise, the dataset is encoded using color (gradients) to visualize line uncertainties.

Lines can be aggregated to simplify the plot. One such way is to measure each line as being typical or outlying. 
P. Micheaux et al. [^7] proposes a new statistical method called **curve depth ** that helps analyze data represented as curves or 
trajectories and labels each line as typical or outlying. Agregating with (Iso)contours is another common 
visualization technique to reduce clutter in spaghetti plots [^10]. F. Ferstl [^9] extends
this idea by incorporating conditional probability visualizations to reveal joint occurrences of contours across 
different regions, offering a more informative and less cluttered alternative to traditional spaghetti plots.


<Cite papers={papers} paperId="mst/wei2011parallel" /> introduces a
GPU-optimized Expectation Maximization algorithm for clustering large-scale
point data. Although this method is able to establish a great seed for reaching
some local optimum, expert-led clustering is expected to achieve a better
clustering
<Cite papers={papers} paperId="mst/rsos.211189" />. This paper will focus on
creating better tools for experts to cluster the data in a more effective way.

An expert lead tool has been developed by A. Popa <Cite papers={papers} paperId="mst/2022_gch_andra" />. This tool allows the user to select points in a 2D space and cluster them. This paper will focus on extending this tool to a higher dimension by directly selecting lines.

## Evaluation metric

1. A user is able to select and group out of a large co-hort of lines with low FP/FN
1. When a semi-automatic brush is implemented, the stearing of the user should be as minimal as posible. This means the automatic part should score at least some percentage in some artificial/real datasets when selecting/grouping lines.
1. As an additional benefit of the project, it should be straightforward to create your own data plot using your own dataset.

## Weekly planning

As my thesis will be user-driven I will spend at least a few hours every week on some user feedback. I have planned the weekly schedule fairly conservatively; some weeks could eventually contain +50% of the work as listed below. However, due to my user-driven approach, I must remain flexible and adjust my planning based on the feedback I receive. The current planning is as broadly as follows:

- **Week 1-3:** How to select lines using a basic brush
- **Week 4-6:** Research and implement an effective way to cluster lines
- **Week 7-9:** Implement a semi-automatic brush to give the user some guidance

Basic user feedback can occur after week 6, while the core of the application can be tested after week 9. The time beyond week 9 will be used to enhance the application further and explore how its core can be extended toward a more standalone technical paper.

- **Q1** - Have the core of the application ready for meaningfull user feedback
- **Q2** - Explore possible extensions (as listed below)
- **Q3** - In addition to implementing others' work, I will delve deeper into the technical details of rendering the lines. This will elevate the paper beyond simply being an application that renders a pre-selected dataset. A potential end goal could be to also render graphs, area plots, or other examples from the D3 library.

### Possible extensions

Based on the results of the first nine weeks, I will decide on the next steps. These could be:

- Going in depth on the rendering of millions of lines in a WebGPU environment
- Implementing a more advanced brush
- Implement multiple (3+) levels of focus/context. For giving the user a better way to focus on what lines are more or less likely to be added to the current selection. Forinstance:
  1. Selected lines (Highlight colour + Shadow)
  2. Selected Cluster groups (Faded Colour)
  3. Unselected Cluster groups (Display as Mean+Std similar to A. Popa <Cite papers={papers} paperId="mst/2022_gch_andra" />)
  4. Noise lines (blurred in the background)
  5. All other lines (Density plot)
