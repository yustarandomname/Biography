# Territory patterns created by random walker agents in three dimensions

## Abstract

> This research paper proposes a discrete agent-based model to simulate territorial development among micro-organisms. The
> model involves two species that interact through marker signals left behind by agents as they move through a three-dimensional
> lattice. The study builds on previous research that established a phase transition from a well-mixed to a well-segregated state
> for two-dimensional lattices. This research extends the finding to three dimensions and confirms that the properties observed
> in the two-dimensional model are also present in the three-dimensional model. We conclude that the addition of more mass or
> the ratio between gamma and lambda behaves similarly to the two-dimensional model. However, the three-dimensional model
> needs a larger mass to reach the same critical point as the two-dimensional one.

Territory formation has been studied in depth in two dimensions (2D) in many other papers.
Some applications include bacteria <Cite papers={papers} paperId="bst/Motility analysis of bacteria-based" />, <Cite papers={papers} paperId="bst/Englert_Manson_Jayaraman_2009" />
or fungi <Cite papers={papers} paperId="bst/Khokon.2021" />. Micro-organisms will often use chemo repellents to establish and maintain their territories,
and to avoid direct competition with other species <Cite papers={papers} paperId="bst/GUILLENGONZALEZ2022193" />. By excreting these chemicals, micro-organisms can create a chemical
boundary that serves as a warning to other organisms to avoid direct contact. This can be especially important in environments where
resources are limited and competition for those resources is high. By avoiding direct competition with other species, organisms can
increase their chances of survival and reproduction. Another notable example of territory formation in two dimensions is the territories
of human gangs, which were researched by A. Alsenafi and A.B. Barbaro <Cite papers={papers} paperId="bst/ALSENAFI2018765" /> (hereafter referred to as the previous territory paper).
In their paper, a model is proposed for gang territory using graffiti. Two gangs will leave behind their own graffiti tags at different
locations that the other gang will attempt to avoid. The paper studies biased random agent movement on a two-dimensional (2D) lattice.
However, the same model can be extended to micro-organisms living in a three-dimensional (3D) lattice. To make the model more applicable
to our case, our paper replaces gangs with species, graffiti with (chemo-repellent) markers, and gang members with agents.

The purpose of this paper is to show how a random walker model behaves in three dimensions with different strengths of avoidance for opposing species.
The main question attempted to be answered is: “What similarities exist between properties of the twodimensional and three-dimensional
lattice models?”. This question is answered with the following sub-questions: "What are the states of the three-dimensional lattice model,
and are they well-mixed or well-segregated?", "How does mass and gamma/lambda ratio influence the phase transition of the 3D model?".

The paper is structured in the following way: First, <AutoRef map={map} label="Background and related work" /> shows the background which is

<AutoRef map={map} label="A Naive model" /> shows an intuitive algorithm derived from mathematics. <AutoRef map={map} label="CPU improvements" /> and 
<AutoRef map={map} label="GPU improvements" /> demonstrate how CPU (Central Processing Unit) and GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) parallel computing 
can improve the performance of the model. <AutoRef map={map} label="Visualisations" /> explains how the client is interacting and visualising the model. 
<AutoRef map={map} label="Results" /> presents the simulations for multiple configurations. <AutoRef map={map} label="Argumentation and discussion" /> discusses what 
similarities a 3D random walker model creates. <AutoRef map={map} label="Conclusion" /> is the conclusion of the paper. Finally, <AutoRef map={map} label="Responsible Research" /> 
discusses the responsibility and accountability of this research paper.
