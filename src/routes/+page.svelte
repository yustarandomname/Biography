				<b class="text-green-700"> data interaction</b>. In collaboration with the Dutch
				Rijksmuseum, I am developing a new type of data interaction that allows painting
				conservators to identify pigments in paintings. The goal is to make the process of
				clustering 200+ dimensional scans of paintings more efficient.

				The TU Delft library is working on a new template for interactive books. The goal is to make
				learning more interactive and engaging. I am working on the development of a new type of
				<b class="text-green-700">Jupyter notebooks</b> that can be used to create interactive
				books. For this project we would like to see if we can migrate from

				Abstract linear algebra concepts are visualized interactively to enhance student

				This project sprung from the idea that during my high school year I had to carry so many

				a text editor, chat environment, calculator. Use credentials abeltest1@hotmail.com and

				For my bachelors thesis I worked on a model for bacteria mixing in three-dimensions using
				random walker agents. The goal of the project was to create a model that could be used to
				understand how bacteria mix in 3D. Each agent excretes a chemical that replels agents from
				the other kind. This research was a generalisation of A. Barbaro et al. An interactive 3D
				visualization of the model can be found at <a

				This Lava application is an experiment conducted by PRIME to provide first-year students
				with a tangible understanding of directional derivatives in the field. In both physical and
				digital maps, contour lines are used to represent elevation on a 2-dimensional surface.
				These lines form bands that indicate areas of constant elevation. The main task is to
				encourage students to unleash their creativity and draw their own contour lines. These lines
				are then transformed into a 3-dimensional mountain. Students are tasked with placing
				turbines in locations they believe will be affected by lava flowing from the mountain's
				highest point.
