    abstract = "In this paper, we are interested in classifying the different arising (topological) structures of three-dimensional Turing-like patterns. By providing examples for the different structures, we confirm a conjecture regarding these structures within the setup of three-dimensional Turing-like pattern. Furthermore, we investigate how these structures are distributed in the parameter space of the discrete model. We found twofold versions of so-called {"}zero-{"} and {"}one-dimensional{"} structures as well as {"}two-dimensional{"} structures and use our experimental findings to formulate several conjectures for three-dimensional Turing-like patterns and higher-dimensional cases.",

abstract = {In this paper we propose two fully discrete Finite Elements (FE) schemes for a repulsive chemotaxis model with a quadratic production term. The first one, which corresponds to the backward Euler in time with FE in space, is energy-stable in the primitive variables of the model, under a “compatibility” condition on the FE spaces. The second one, which is obtained modifying the scheme proposed in [13] by applying a regularization procedure, has an “approximated positivity” property which is obtained from discrete energy estimates and an additional estimate for a singular functional. These properties are not available in previous approaches. Additionally, we study the well-posedness and the long time behaviour of the schemes, obtaining exponential convergence to constant states as in the continuous problem. Finally, we compare the numerical schemes throughout several numerical simulations, which are in agreement with the theoretical results.}

    abstract = { Making use of experimental data for bias extension, shearing, and point-load tests in large deformation regime for rectangular and square bi-pantographic specimens, we perform a numerical identification to fit the a priori parameters of a planar discrete spring model. The main objective of the work is to develop an automatized optimization process based on the Nelder–Mead simplex algorithm for identifying the constitutive parameters of discrete modeling of bi-pantographic structures, as well as assessing its descriptiveness and predictive capacity. The analysis allows to conclude that there exists a single set of parameters for the adopted discrete modeling such that it is descriptive and predictive for several different tests and for a wide range of deformations. }

They also become the major techniques in cluster analysis. In this paper, we give a survey of fuzzy clustering in three categories. The first category is the fuzzy clustering based on fuzzy relation. The second one is the fuzzy clustering based on objective function. Finally, we give an overview of a nonparametric classifier. That is the fuzzy generalized k-nearest neighbor rule.}
